### Hello, World! 👋

I'm a Senior Customer Engineer at Microsoft, currently focusing on educating and supporting customers through their software development modernisation and DevOps journies - both from a cultural and technical standpoint.

Things I love to get involved with:

- Azure and Azure DevOps
- DevOps practices and culture
- GitHub

My favourite topics in this space are CI/CD pipelines and GitHub workflows 🐱‍💻🚀
